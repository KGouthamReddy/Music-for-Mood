# Music-for-Mood
Music Player based on real time facial expressions using Keras, openCV, Deep Face.


# Module -1 (Music Player)

## Required Programming Skills - 
1.HTML
2.CSS
3.JAVA SCRIPT
4.PHP
5.BOOTSTRAP

First creating a website which is user interactive and have many interface like Login, Logout, Registering through email id etc. 

HTML for all text in skeleton structure.
CSS for adding colors UI for better interactivness.
JavaScript for adding functionality.
PHP for storing user details and validating while logging in.
Bootstrap for icons, buttons etc.


# Module -2 (Face Expression Detection)

## Required Skills - 
1. Python
2. Machine Learning Algorithms
3. Deep Learning towards AI

Python for getting built-in libraries, other additional libraries to read and write the data.
Machine Learning Algorithms for understanding how the data can be managed to build a model.
Deep Learning for finding out the facial expressions through Python libraries.

## Important libraries -
1. OpenCV-python
2. Keras
3. Matplotlib
4. Harcascade files
5. Deep Face

All the above things need to installed using pip. eg. pip install opencv-python 
Need to have brief information in those important libraries. Those only work by installing before importing them in your model. Search in google if you have any error then u will find your own errors. #use of Stackoverflow.
